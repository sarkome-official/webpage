## Roadmap

- **Phase 1: Semantic Ingestion**: Constructing the Biomedical Knowledge Graph.
- **Phase 2: The Neuro-Symbolic Logic Engine**: Enabling the system to generate novel hypotheses.
- **Phase 3: *In Silico* Simulation**: Validating candidates via structural docking and digital twins.
- **Phase 4: The Wet-Lab Validation Loop**: Converting digital code into biological results.
