## ASPS

Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (ASPS) is an ultra-rare, malignant soft tissue sarcoma driven by a single chromosomal translocation: **t(X;17)(p11;q25)**, fusing **ASPSCR1** and **TFE3**.

- **Driver**: ASPSCR1-TFE3 fusion protein.
- **Mechanism**: Nuclear hijacking, epigenetic rewiring, and massive angiogenesis.
- **Challenge**: Chemotherapy resistance and "orphan" status.
