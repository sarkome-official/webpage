## The Epistemological Gap

In the context of ultra-rare diseases like ASPS, our current operating model, facilitating bibliographic search and data retrieval, is **epistemologically insufficient**.

- **Stochastic Hallucination**: LLMs operate on statistical probability, not biological truth. They can invent plausible but biologically impossible mechanisms.
- **Fragmented Causality**: Search engines cannot independently infer causality from scattered correlation.
- **Inability to Reason**: Standard systems fail at **multi-hop reasoning**.

We address these gaps through our [Neuro-Symbolic Discovery Engine](/docs/platform), which enforces biological rules to eliminate hallucination and uses causal inference to identify true therapeutic drivers.
