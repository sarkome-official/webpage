### A Personal Commitment

At the core of the Sarkome Institute and everything we do is a story that is deeply personal. Sarkome was not born in a boardroom or a VC office; it was born from the pain of life.

**GARP** (Gerald Alexander Ramirez Palacios) is the very foundation of this institute. Sarkome exists because he fought a brave battle against **Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (ASPS)**, and eventually, we lost him. Like so many families facing rare diseases, we experienced first-hand the frustration of a medical system that often lacks the answers, the specific research, or even the basic data to find them.

His struggle changed everything for me. It transformed a technical path into a lifelong mission: to ensure that no other family has to face that same sense of helplessness. 

Sarkome is my way of honoring his memory. We are not just building algorithms or discovering drugs; we are building the "biological certainty" that was missing when he needed it most. We do this with deep humility, knowing the weight of the responsibility we carry, and with the unwavering determination that the knowledge he couldn't benefit from will be the knowledge that saves others.

This work is for him, and for every patient still waiting for a systematic path to a cure.
