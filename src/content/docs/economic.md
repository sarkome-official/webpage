# The Economic Winning: Building Intelligence Through Human-AI Symbiosis

## The Problem with Pure Automation

Most AI systems promise to "replace experts." Sarkome takes the opposite stance: **the system gets smarter by learning from them**.

The Virtual Mind isn't born knowing everything about ASPS biology—it becomes an expert through a symbiotic relationship with human domain specialists. But we can't afford to hire every PhD in oncology. So we've architected an economic model where **expertise becomes scalable**.

## The Contributor Economy

### Who Can Teach the Virtual Mind?

We don't need Nobel laureates. We need **verified, specialized knowledge workers** who can:

1. **Curate**: Flag high-quality papers, annotate protein structures, validate drug-target interactions.
2. **Correct**: Identify hallucinations, mark false edges in the graph, challenge weak causal chains.
3. **Extend**: Add domain-specific context the LLMs miss—clinical nuances, experimental gotchas, negative results buried in supplementary data.

**Eligibility Requirement**: You must be enrolled in (or have graduated from) specific university programs:

- **Biology/Biochemistry/Molecular Biology** (BSc minimum)
- **Bioinformatics/Computational Biology** (MSc preferred)
- **Medicine/Oncology** (MD, Resident, or Clinical Fellow)
- **Pharmaceutical Sciences/Drug Discovery** (PhD or Industry R&D)

We verify credentials through university APIs or LinkedIn attestation. This isn't gatekeeping—it's **quality control**. The Virtual Mind's intelligence is only as good as the humans refining it.

## How It Works: API Access as Incentive

Contributors don't work for equity or vague "impact points." They get **direct access to the most powerful oncology reasoning engine on the planet**.

### The Incentive Model

1. **Contribution Credits**: Every validated correction, curated dataset, or graph refinement earns you credits.
   
2. **API Access Tiers**:
   - **Bronze** (100 credits): 1,000 API calls/month. Suitable for thesis research, hypothesis generation.
   - **Silver** (500 credits): 10,000 calls/month + access to molecular dynamics validation tools.
   - **Gold** (2,000 credits): Unlimited calls + ability to spawn private research subgraphs for proprietary work.

3. **Credit Velocity**: High-impact contributions (e.g., catching a critical hallucination, adding a breakthrough paper) multiply your credit earnings. The system learns *who* to trust faster.

### What You Get

- **Research Superpowers**: Query the Virtual Mind for causal hypotheses. "What metabolic vulnerabilities exist in ASPS that haven't been targeted?" The system returns not just papers, but *reasoned arguments* with molecular evidence.
  
- **Collaboration Network**: Contributors see anonymized patterns of what others are researching. If three labs are independently probing the same pathway, the system can broker introductions.

- **Publication Priority**: If the Virtual Mind generates a novel hypothesis that you validate experimentally, you co-author with "Sarkome Institute AI Council" but retain first-author rights. We don't own your discoveries—we *enable* them.

## The Economic Flywheel

This model creates a self-reinforcing loop:

1. **Better Data → Smarter AI**: Human experts correct the graph, making the Virtual Mind more accurate.
2. **Smarter AI → More Users**: Researchers hear that Sarkome's predictions actually *work*, driving adoption.
3. **More Users → More Contributions**: Higher usage means more edge cases discovered, more corrections submitted.
4. **More Contributions → Better Data**: The cycle accelerates.

### Why This Beats Traditional Models

- **Pharma R&D**: Spends $2.6B per drug, mostly on failed experiments. We crowdsource the *thinking* before anyone touches a pipette.
- **Academic Publishing**: Keeps knowledge locked in PDFs. We turn it into a living, queryable reasoning graph.
- **AI Startups**: Hallucinate confidently. We have a **human validation firewall** at every layer.

## The Business Capture

Here's the kicker: while contributors get API access for free (via credits), **commercial entities pay**.

- **Biotech/Pharma**: $50K-$500K/year for enterprise API access. They get the same reasoning engine, but their queries don't earn credits—they pay cash.
- **CROs/Consulting**: License the platform for client work. We take 20% of project value.
- **Spin-Out Assets**: When the Virtual Mind identifies a drug candidate (e.g., "Compound X inhibits ASPS-specific fusion protein"), we form a single-asset company. Contributors who flagged key papers in that pathway get **microgrants** (~$1K-$5K) + equity options if the company raises a Series A.

### The Moat

Other AI companies can train bigger models. They can't replicate:

1. **The Curated Graph**: Years of expert-validated, hyperspecialized oncology topology.
2. **The Contributor Network**: Thousands of domain experts who treat the platform as *their* research tool.
3. **The Trust Layer**: Every prediction has a human-verified causal chain, not just an embedding similarity score.

## Why Students and Early Researchers Win

If you're a grad student or postdoc, you're resource-constrained. You don't have $100K for a Palantir Foundry license or a team of research assistants. But you have:

- **Time** to read papers and annotate data.
- **Expertise** in a narrow domain (even if you're still learning the broader field).
- **Motivation** to publish, graduate, or pivot into industry.

Sarkome gives you **institutional-grade AI infrastructure** in exchange for doing what you already do: reading papers, validating claims, and asking hard questions. Except now, every hour you spend makes you more powerful for the *next* project.

### The Long-Term Play

In 5 years, the best ASPS researchers in the world won't use PubMed. They'll query the Virtual Mind because it:

- Knows *everything* about ASPS (Hot Memory).
- Connects to adjacent fields automatically (Warm Memory).
- Resurfaces forgotten breakthroughs when they become relevant again (Cold Memory reactivation).

And they'll be contributors, not just users—shaping the intelligence that shapes their field.

## The Pitch in One Sentence

**We're building the world's most specialized oncology reasoning engine by paying domain experts in the currency they actually want: superpowers.**

You don't need to believe in altruism or open source idealism. You just need to believe that smart people will trade their knowledge for tools that make them 10x more effective. And once they do, the system becomes **unreplicably intelligent**.

That's the economic winning. Not extracting value from experts—**multiplying it**.
