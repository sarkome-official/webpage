# What the Sarkome Institute Is

The Sarkome Institute is a permanent, biology-first organization whose primary output is de-risked therapeutic programs, not papers, platforms, or single-asset startups.

It operates as a central scientific foundry: hypotheses are generated internally, validated through a unified technical and causal framework, and advanced only until biological and translational uncertainty has been sufficiently reduced to create a clear, monetizable asset. The Institute remains the epistemic and operational core; downstream structures are optional, instrumental, and transaction-driven.

Sarkome is not a startup, not a VC fund, and not an academic institute. It is the entity that exists before capitalization, spin-out, or acquisition become rational decisions.

## Why the Sarkome Institute Exists

Modern biotech is trapped between two failing extremes:

### Asset-centric startups
- **Fast and capital-efficient**
- **Structurally binary:** one molecule fails → company dies
- **Incentivize premature clinical bets on weak causal understanding**

### Platform companies
- **Promise diversification**
- **Accumulate infrastructure faster than insight**
- **Suffer from capital bloat, unclear value capture, and weak asset accountability**

Both models mis-handle the core problem in rare and complex disease: the epistemological gap between genetic knowledge and viable therapy.

Knowing what mutation causes a disease is trivial. Knowing how to intervene causally, safely, and durably is not. That gap cannot be closed inside a single asset company, nor inside a generalized platform optimized for valuation rather than truth.

The Sarkome Institute exists to institutionalize causal biological understanding as a first-class economic product.

## What Makes It a Venture Institute

The Sarkome Institute represents a third organizational form: the Venture Institute. It is built on two foundational pillars:

- **[The Virtual Mind](philosophy)**: A cognitive architecture that transforms Graph Vector Search into a living, pruning memory system.
- **[The Economic Model](economic)**: A symbiotic relationship where domain experts trade knowledge for AI-driven research superpowers.

A Venture Institute is defined by four properties:

### 1. Epistemology-first structure (The Virtual Mind)
- **Long-lived scientific memory**: We utilize a **Graph Vector Search** architecture that functions as a "Virtual Mind"—a semantic topology where proteins, images, and text are unified. See the [Philosophy](philosophy) for more.
- **Memory Temperature**: Knowledge is managed through "synaptic pruning," where active research stays in "Hot Memory" while unused data is inactivated into "Cold Memory" to save resources without losing the potential for reactivation.
- **Shared models, data, and inference methods**: Multi-modal agents interact with this memory to perform generative cognition.
- **Progress measured by causal resolution, not storytelling milestones**: The system discovers novel causal chains through transitive inference and analogical reasoning.

### 2. Internal asset generation (foundry model)
- Ideas originate inside the Institute
- Validation precedes capitalization
- Programs advance only while uncertainty is collapsing. See the [Economic Model](economic) for how we scale this expertise.

### 3. Operator-principal role
- The Institute designs, validates, and controls early execution
- Scientific and technical authority is centralized
- No dependence on fragile external founding teams

### 4. Exit-agnostic capital alignment
- Capital is deployed to reduce uncertainty, not to sustain corporate shells

Each program is structured to support multiple rational outcomes:
- Sale of the asset
- Concession / licensing to a pharmaceutical partner
- (Optionally) spin-out, only if it maximizes value

In this model, companies are optional containers, not the goal.

## How Sarkome Differs From Adjacent Models

- **Versus VC funds**: VC funds allocate capital to external teams. Sarkome converts causal insight into transactible biological assets.
- **Versus venture studios**: Studios optimize for speed and surface-level validation. Sarkome optimizes for deep causal certainty under extreme biological risk.
- **Versus academic institutes**: Academia produces knowledge without ownership pressure. Sarkome binds knowledge to economic consequence.
- **Versus platforms**: Platforms sell infrastructure. Sarkome sells collapsed uncertainty.

## The Core Thesis

Sarkome operationalizes this model through AI not as a predictive oracle, but as a mechanism for generating missing biological knowledge. The Institute uses logic-constrained and physics-aware AI to formalize causal hypotheses, resolve ambiguity in sparse rare-disease data, and convert previously implicit biological assumptions into explicit, testable structure. This transforms rare-disease drug discovery—such as in ASPS—from probabilistic guessing into a systematic process of causal discovery, where uncertainty is intentionally collapsed before capital is deployed.

## Generator of Biological Certainty

This capability transforms the organization’s identity. Sarkome is not a "drug developer" in the traditional sense; it is a **Generator of Biological Certainty**.

The organization exists to perform key functions that create investable assets:

1.  **Ingest Data**: We gather vast quantities of noisy clinical and biological data, combining different sources that traditional models often overlook.
2.  **Sanitize Data**: We clean this data using strict logic rules (solving problems like "hemangioma mimicry") to create a reliable "ground truth" that competitors lack.
3.  **Generate Hypotheses**: We create high-quality therapeutic theories (e.g., interface-specific PROTACs) that are chemically possible and biologically plausible.
4.  **Validate Physically**: We confirm these theories in the lab using fast testing loops (NanoBRET, Cryo-EM) to prove structural reality before major capital investment.
5.  **Spin Out**: Finally, we spin out the validated asset into a focused commercial entity.

## The "Sniper Unit" Philosophy

Sarkome rejects the "shotgun" approach of high-throughput screening used by large pharmaceutical companies, which relies on statistical probability across thousands of weak hypotheses. Instead, it adopts a **"sniper" philosophy**.

This organisational identity is specifically designed to appeal to private investors and family offices seeking efficiency and capital discipline.

### A Lean, High-Expertise Hub
- **No Capital Bloat**: The Institute does not build massive, permanent laboratories for every possible situation, nor does it carry the costs of a large administrative staff.
- **The "Hub" Model**: We maintain a lean, high-expertise core team—the "Hub"—that only deploys capital to specialized Contract Research Organizations (CROs) and academic partners when a hypothesis meets strict logical and physical criteria.
- **Private ARPA model**: Empowered program managers drive ambitious goals with finite resources and strict timelines, free from the bureaucracy of traditional academia or big pharma.

### Ruthless Capital Discipline
The Institute’s primary value proposition is its ability to **kill bad ideas quickly**—often through digital simulations (in silico) or low-cost lab tests—and accelerate good ones aggressively. 

This ensures that investor funds are concentrated on assets with the highest probability of success, rather than being wasted on expensive infrastructure.
