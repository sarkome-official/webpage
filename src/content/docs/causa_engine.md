# The Causal Engine

## Context
- Biotechnology is currently split between high-risk single-asset startups and capital-inefficient platform companies.
- Sarkome Institute proposes a **Venture Institute** model that separating the **discovery engine (Hub)** from **therapeutic assets (Spokes)** to manage risk and capital allocation.

## Core Thesis
- Drug discovery is reframed from stochastic screening to **deterministic causal inference**.
- **Focus:** Undruggable transcription factor fusions, exemplified by **TFE3-driven rare malignancies (ASPS)**.

## Technological Stack: Neuro-Symbolic Causal Engine
- **Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs):** Enforce biological and causal constraints, mitigating data scarcity.
- **Generative Protein Design (AlphaFold–Metainference):** Explores structural hypotheses beyond resolved conformations.
- **Thermodynamic and Molecular Dynamics Validation:** Filters generative artifacts, especially in disordered regions.
- **Integration:** Integrated into a single industrial workflow rather than a collection of modular tools.

## Why Conventional Methods Fail
**HTS (High-Throughput Screening)** and **FBDD (Fragment-Based Drug Discovery)** are often ineffective against transcription factor fusions due to:
- Intrinsic disorder.
- Absence of stable binding pockets.

Empirical failure across the field indicates structural, not executional, limits in current methodologies.

## Sarkome’s Targeted Solutions
- **Semantic Firewall:** Logical reasoning compensates for sparse and noisy clinical/biological data.
- **Generative Forge:** Physics-based simulation addresses disorder where structure-first methods fail.

## Risk Analysis
The Causal Engine is a **single point of existential failure** for the thesis. Its value depends on:
- Neuro-symbolic AI outperforming LLMs in clinical data sanitization.
- Molecular dynamics reliably eliminating hallucinations in disordered proteins.

The Hub-and-Spoke structure absorbs asset-level failures, but not the invalidation of the engine itself.

## Conclusion
- The Causal Engine is not just an optimization; it is **necessary** for solving the target pathology.
- Failure of the engine invalidates the industrialized discovery thesis.
- Relative to the near-certain failure of conventional approaches, Sarkome represents a **high-risk, high-reward attempt to generate biological certainty where none currently exists**.
