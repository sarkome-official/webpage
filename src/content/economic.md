# The Contributor Economy: Building Intelligence Through Collaboration

## Beyond Pure Automation

Most AI platforms promise to "replace experts." Sarkome takes the opposite approach: **the platform gets smarter by learning from domain specialists**.

The Virtual Mind isn't born knowing everything about cancer biology—it becomes an expert through a symbiotic relationship with researchers. We've designed an economic model where **expertise becomes scalable** and **contributions are rewarded**.

## Who Can Contribute?

We don't need Nobel laureates. We need **verified, specialized knowledge workers** who can:

### Curate
- Flag high-quality papers
- Annotate protein structures
- Validate drug-target interactions
- Highlight important findings that automated systems miss

### Correct
- Identify AI hallucinations
- Mark false edges in the knowledge graph
- Challenge weak causal chains
- Point out outdated or superseded information

### Extend
- Add domain-specific context that general AI models miss
- Document clinical nuances and experimental details
- Surface negative results often buried in supplementary data
- Connect isolated findings to broader research contexts

## Contribution Types

### Knowledge Graph Enrichment
- Validate or refute proposed relationships
- Add new entities and connections
- Annotate edge confidence levels
- Provide context for ambiguous relationships

### Literature Annotation
- Highlight key findings in papers
- Tag relevant entities and relationships
- Mark paper quality and reliability
- Identify retracted or disputed claims

### Query Feedback
- Rate the quality of agent responses
- Suggest improvements to reasoning chains
- Flag missing considerations
- Provide alternative interpretations

### Hypothesis Validation
- Evaluate generated therapeutic hypotheses
- Provide expert assessment of feasibility
- Suggest additional evidence or counterarguments
- Rate confidence in proposed mechanisms

## The Incentive Model

Contributors don't work for vague "impact points." They receive **direct value**:

### API Access Tiers

Validated contributions unlock platform capabilities:

| Tier | Requirements | Benefits |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Community** | Verified researcher account | Basic platform access, limited queries |
| **Contributor** | Regular validated contributions | Enhanced query limits, priority processing |
| **Expert** | High-impact contributions | Advanced features, early access to new tools |
| **Partner** | Sustained high-quality work | Collaboration opportunities, research credits |

### What You Get

#### Research Superpowers
Query the Virtual Mind with complex questions that would take days of manual research to answer. Generate hypotheses, explore pathways, and discover connections instantly.

#### Network Effects
Connect with other researchers exploring similar questions. The platform can broker introductions when multiple labs are independently investigating the same mechanisms.

#### Recognition
High-quality contributors are acknowledged in platform documentation and may be invited to collaborate on publications or projects.

## The Knowledge Flywheel

This model creates a self-reinforcing loop:

```
Better Data → Smarter AI → More Useful → More Users → 
More Contributions → Better Data...
```

### Stage 1: Quality Data
Expert corrections and extensions improve the knowledge graph's accuracy.

### Stage 2: Smarter Reasoning
Higher-quality data leads to more reliable AI outputs.

### Stage 3: Increased Value
Researchers discover that Sarkome's predictions actually work, driving adoption.

### Stage 4: More Contributions
Higher usage reveals more edge cases and opportunities for improvement.

### Stage 5: Flywheel Accelerates
Each contribution makes the platform more valuable, attracting more contributors.

## Why Researchers Win

If you're a graduate student, postdoc, or researcher at any level, you're resource-constrained. You don't have:
- A team of research assistants
- Unlimited access to expensive databases
- Time to manually review thousands of papers

But you do have:
- **Expertise** in your specific research domain
- **Time** invested in reading papers and understanding your field
- **Motivation** to accelerate your own research

Sarkome gives you **institutional-grade AI infrastructure** in exchange for doing what you already do: reading papers, validating claims, and asking hard questions. Every contribution makes you more effective for your *next* research project.

## Quality Control

Not all contributions are equal. The platform implements multi-layer validation:

### Credential Verification
- Academic email verification
- ORCID integration
- Publication history validation

### Contribution Scoring
- Cross-validation against other expert assessments
- Consistency tracking over time
- Impact measurement (did this correction improve downstream outputs?)

### Reputation System
- Expertise areas are tracked and weighted
- Contributions outside one's demonstrated expertise receive additional scrutiny
- High-reputation contributors can validate others' work

## The Long-Term Vision

In five years, the most effective oncology researchers won't rely solely on PubMed searches. They'll query intelligent systems that:

- **Know everything** relevant to their research (Hot Memory)
- **Connect automatically** to discoveries in adjacent fields (Warm Memory)
- **Resurface forgotten breakthroughs** when they become relevant again (Cold Memory reactivation)

And these researchers will be contributors, not just users—actively shaping the intelligence that powers their discoveries.

## Summary

**We're building the world's most comprehensive oncology reasoning platform by rewarding domain experts with the tools they actually need: research superpowers.**

You don't need to believe in altruism. You just need to see that smart researchers will trade their domain knowledge for tools that make them dramatically more effective. And once they do, the system becomes **unreplicably intelligent**.

That's the contributor economy: not extracting value from experts, but **multiplying it**.
