# Economic Model: Pay-Per-Use Intelligence

## Philosophy: Transparent, Usage-Based Pricing

Most AI platforms lock you into expensive subscriptions whether you use them or not. Sarkome takes a different approach: **you pay for what you use, when you use it**.

We believe that researchers and clinicians should have access to cutting-edge AI-powered oncology tools without prohibitive upfront costs. Our pricing model is designed to be:

- **Transparent**: You see exactly what each query costs before you run it.
- **Fair**: Costs are directly tied to actual computational resources consumed.
- **Flexible**: Multiple tiers to match your usage patterns and budget.

## How Pricing Works

### The Formula

Every query has a clear cost breakdown:

```
Query Cost = LLM Cost + Platform Fee (50%)
```

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **LLM Cost** | The actual cost of tokens processed by the language model (input + output tokens) |
| **Platform Fee** | 50% markup on LLM cost to cover infrastructure, R&D, and platform maintenance |

### Example Costs

| Query Type | Estimated LLM Cost | Platform Fee (50%) | Total Cost |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Simple question | $0.02 | $0.01 | **$0.03** |
| Standard research query | $0.10 | $0.05 | **$0.15** |
| Deep analysis (high effort) | $0.40 | $0.20 | **$0.60** |
| Complex multi-tool query | $0.80 | $0.40 | **$1.20** |

*Costs vary based on model selection, effort level, and tools used.*

## Pricing Tiers

### Tier 1: Pay-As-You-Go

**Best for**: Occasional users, researchers exploring the platform.

- No monthly commitment
- Pay only for queries you run
- Full access to all platform features
- Real-time cost estimation before each query

### Tier 2: Infrastructure Subscription + Usage

**Best for**: Regular users who want predictable baseline costs.

| Plan | Monthly Base | What's Included | Usage Pricing |
|------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Starter** | $29/month | Priority support, query history, patient records | LLM cost + 40% (reduced fee) |
| **Professional** | $99/month | All Starter features + API access, team collaboration | LLM cost + 30% (reduced fee) |
| **Institution** | Custom | Dedicated infrastructure, SLA, compliance features | Volume discounts + negotiated rates |

The monthly base covers infrastructure maintenance, data storage, and premium features. Usage fees are reduced as a benefit of your subscription.

### Tier 3: Bring Your Own LLM (BYOLLM)

**Best for**: Organizations with existing AI infrastructure, privacy-conscious institutions.

| Plan | Monthly Cost | What You Get |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| **BYOLLM Basic** | $49/month | Platform access, knowledge graph, AlphaFold integration |
| **BYOLLM Pro** | $149/month | Basic + API access, priority routing, advanced analytics |
| **BYOLLM Enterprise** | Custom | Pro + on-premise deployment options, custom integrations |

**How it works**:
1. Connect your own LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, Azure, self-hosted)
2. Sarkome handles orchestration, knowledge graph traversal, and tool routing
3. You pay only for platform infrastructure; LLM costs go directly to your provider

## Cost Transparency

### Before Every Query

You'll see a cost estimate before submitting:

```
Estimated Cost Breakdown
------------------------
Model: Gemini 2.0 Flash
Effort Level: Medium
Tools: Web Search, Knowledge Graph

Estimated tokens: ~8,000
LLM cost: ~$0.08
Platform fee: ~$0.04
------------------------
Total estimate: ~$0.12
```

### Usage Dashboard

Track your spending with detailed analytics:

- Daily, weekly, monthly cost breakdowns
- Cost per query type and tool
- Token usage patterns
- Budget alerts and limits

## Enterprise & Research Institutions

### Volume Commitments

For organizations processing significant query volumes, we offer:

| Commitment | Discount |
|------------|----------|
| $500+/month | 10% off platform fees |
| $2,000+/month | 20% off platform fees |
| $10,000+/month | Custom enterprise pricing |

### Academic Partnerships

Universities and research hospitals may qualify for:

- Reduced platform fees (up to 50% off)
- Grant-compatible invoicing
- Collaborative research opportunities
- Co-publication options for platform improvements

## Why This Model Works

### For Researchers

- **Low barrier to entry**: Try the platform without a large upfront investment
- **Scalable costs**: Scale usage up or down as your project demands
- **No waste**: You never pay for capacity you don't use

### For Sarkome

- **Sustainable growth**: Revenue scales with actual platform value delivered
- **Aligned incentives**: We succeed when you use the platform successfully
- **Quality focus**: We're motivated to make every query worth its cost

### For the Ecosystem

- **Accessible AI**: Cutting-edge oncology AI becomes available to smaller labs
- **Fair competition**: Pricing transparency prevents vendor lock-in
- **Innovation funding**: Platform fees directly fund R&D and improvements

## Comparison to Traditional Models

| Aspect | Traditional SaaS | Sarkome Pay-Per-Use |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| Monthly cost | Fixed ($200-2000+) | Variable (based on usage) |
| Unused capacity | You pay anyway | You pay nothing |
| Cost predictability | High (but inflexible) | Estimable per query |
| Barrier to try | High | Very low |
| Scaling down | Often penalized | Automatic |
| Scaling up | Requires plan upgrade | Seamless |

## Summary

**Sarkome's economic model is simple: pay for what you use, see what you're paying, and never get locked into something that doesn't work for you.**

We're building the world's most comprehensive oncology reasoning platform, and we want it to be accessible to everyone who can benefit from it—from individual researchers to major institutions.

The best AI tools shouldn't require enterprise budgets. They should be available to anyone willing to invest in better research outcomes.
