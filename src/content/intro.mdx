# What is Sarkome?

**From Genomic Data to Therapeutic Hypotheses in Minutes.**

Sarkome is an AI-powered precision oncology platform that transforms complex genomic data into actionable therapeutic hypotheses. By deploying intelligent agents that reason over the world's largest biomedical knowledge graphs, protein structures, and real-time scientific literature, Sarkome accelerates the path from discovery to treatment.

## The Problem We Solve

Modern cancer research faces critical bottlenecks that slow the discovery of new treatments:

### Data Fragmentation
- **Genomic, proteomic, and clinical data exist in isolated silos**
- Researchers spend 60-80% of their time searching for and integrating information
- Critical connections between mutations, pathways, and treatments remain hidden

### Slow Hypothesis Generation
- Connecting a patient's genetic mutations to potential treatments requires months of manual literature review
- The average researcher reads 200+ papers to form a single therapeutic hypothesis
- By the time a hypothesis is validated, newer research may have superseded it

### Knowledge Overload
- **5,000+ new biomedical papers are published daily**
- No human can stay current with the exponential growth of scientific literature
- Breakthrough discoveries in adjacent fields often go unnoticed

## How Sarkome Works

Sarkome deploys **AI Agents** that perform in minutes what would take researchers weeks:

### 1. Knowledge Graph Reasoning
Our agents traverse **PrimeKG**, a biomedical knowledge graph containing over 4 million entities and 20 million relationships. This enables multi-hop reasoning to discover non-obvious drug-gene-disease connections that no single paper contains.

### 2. Protein Structure Analysis
Integration with **AlphaFold's** database of 200+ million protein structures allows agents to analyze 3D conformations, identify druggable binding pockets, and predict drug-protein interactions at atomic resolution.

### 3. Real-Time Literature Synthesis
Agents retrieve and synthesize findings from PubMed, preprint servers, and clinical trial registries. Every claim is backed by citations—no hallucinations allowed.

### 4. Therapeutic Hypothesis Generation
The output is not a list of papers but a **reasoned therapeutic hypothesis** complete with:
- Confidence scores based on evidence strength
- Mechanism of action explanations
- Next steps for validation

## Who Benefits from Sarkome?

### Oncology Researchers
Accelerate hypothesis generation from months to minutes. Query the knowledge graph with natural language questions like *"What metabolic vulnerabilities exist in KRAS-mutant pancreatic cancer?"* and receive structured, citation-backed responses.

### Pharmaceutical Companies
De-risk early-stage drug discovery by validating mechanisms before committing resources. Identify novel targets that existing pipelines miss.

### Academic Institutions
Give students and postdocs access to institutional-grade AI infrastructure. Level the playing field between well-funded labs and resource-constrained researchers.

### Healthcare Organizations
Explore precision medicine approaches for complex cases where standard-of-care treatments have failed.

## The Technology Stack

Sarkome is built on a modern, scalable architecture:

- **[The Virtual Mind](philosophy)**: A cognitive architecture that transforms graph-based vector search into a living memory system.
- **[Agent Reasoning Pipeline](agent_reasoning)**: A LangGraph-powered workflow combining grounding, reflection, and synthesis.
- **[Knowledge Graph Technology](technology)**: 3D visualization and semantic querying of biomedical relationships.

## Our Focus Areas

While Sarkome supports research across all cancer types, we have particular expertise in:

### Rare and Hard-to-Treat Cancers
Traditional drug discovery economics fail for rare diseases. Sarkome's AI-first approach reduces the cost of hypothesis generation, making rare cancer research economically viable.

### Fusion Oncoprotein-Driven Cancers
Cancers driven by aberrant fusion proteins (like ASPSCR1-TFE3 in ASPS) represent some of the most challenging therapeutic targets. Our platform excels at reasoning about these complex molecular pathologies.

### Precision Medicine Applications
When molecular profiling reveals an unusual mutation pattern, Sarkome helps clinicians and researchers explore therapeutic options beyond established protocols.

## The Vision

In the near future, the most effective cancer researchers won't rely solely on PubMed searches and manual literature review. They'll query intelligent systems that:

- **Know everything** about their disease of interest (active knowledge)
- **Connect automatically** to relevant discoveries in adjacent fields (traversable knowledge)
- **Resurface forgotten breakthroughs** when they become relevant again (reactivated knowledge)

Sarkome is building that future—one therapeutic hypothesis at a time.
