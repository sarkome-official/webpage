# Investors: Investment Opportunity

Investment opportunity in a single-asset entity targeting Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma.

## Investment Thesis

### 1. Monogenic Driver
ASPS is driven by a single fusion protein (ASPSCR1-TFE3), reducing biological risk compared to complex polygenic cancers. This translocation occurs in ~100% of cases, making it a highly specific therapeutic target.

### 2. Validated Modality
Targeted Protein Degradation (TPD) is a proven clinical modality that unlocks previously "undruggable" transcription factors like TFE3. Multiple TPD programs are in clinical development, validating the platform approach.

### 3. Capital Efficient
Our virtual, agentic model eliminates fixed lab infrastructure costs. Capital is directed straight to asset generation and validation through CRO partnerships, reducing burn rate and extending runway.

## Market Opportunity

- **Primary Market**: Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (ASPS)
  - Rare orphan indication (~500–1,000 new cases/year globally)
  - Orphan Drug Designation provides 7 years market exclusivity
  - High unmet medical need; limited treatment options

- **Expansion Market**: Translocation-associated Renal Cell Carcinoma (tRCC)
  - 5–10% of RCC cases (~5,000–10,000 cases/year in US)
  - TFE3-rearranged subset responsive to same therapeutic approach
  - Larger addressable market for clinical expansion

## Data Room Access

Qualified investors may request access to our Virtual Data Room (VDR) containing:

## Executive Summary

Sarkome is a single-asset entity focused on SAR-001, a selective PROTAC degrader for ASPSCR1-TFE3 in ASPS. We execute drug discovery through agentic AI and cloud-based CRO partnerships, achieving superior efficiency and speed-to-clinic compared to traditional biotech. Our 5-year roadmap targets IND filing in Q4 2027 and Phase 1 readout by year 4+, with clear pathways to Series A (Lead Declaration), Series B (Preclinical Candidate), and commercial partnerships post-Phase 1 data.
