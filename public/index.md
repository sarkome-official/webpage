# ASPS Therapeutics Discovery Initiative

## Mission
To develop SAR-001, a selective PROTAC degrader targeting the ASPSCR1-TFE3 fusion protein in Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (ASPS).

## Overview
Sarkome is a single-asset entity (SAE) dedicated to identifying, validating, and licensing a selective protein degrader for ASPS. We utilize an agentic AI core coupled with cloud-based CRO partners to execute drug discovery efficiently.

## Key Scientific Facts
- **Target Disease**: Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (ASPS)
- **Genetic Driver**: ASPSCR1-TFE3 fusion protein
- **Therapeutic Modality**: Targeted Protein Degradation (PROTACs)
- **Research Focus**: Target discovery, computational modeling, VEGF pathway, MET signaling.
