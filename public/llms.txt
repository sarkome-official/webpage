## 1. What is Sarkome?

**Quick Answer:** Sarkome is an AI-powered precision oncology platform that transforms genomic data into actionable therapeutic hypotheses in minutes. It uses intelligent agents that reason over biomedical knowledge graphs, protein structures (AlphaFold), and real-time scientific literature.

### The Problem We Solve
Traditional oncology research faces critical bottlenecks:
1. **Data Fragmentation**: Genomic, proteomic, and clinical data exist in silos.
2. **Slow Hypothesis Generation**: Connecting mutations to treatments takes months of manual research.
3. **Knowledge Overload**: 5,000+ new biomedical papers published daily make it impossible for humans to stay current.

### Our Solution
Sarkome deploys **AI Agents** that:
- **Ingest** patient genomic profiles and tumor characteristics.
- **Traverse** the world's largest biomedical knowledge graph (PrimeKG: 4M+ nodes, 20M+ relationships).
- **Analyze** 3D protein structures from AlphaFold to identify druggable pockets.
- **Synthesize** findings with real-time literature to generate validated therapeutic hypotheses.

## 2. Key Capabilities

### 2.1 Knowledge Graph Reasoning
- **Database**: PrimeKG (Diseases, Drugs, Genes, Proteins, Pathways, Side Effects).
- **Reasoning**: Multi-hop traversal to discover non-obvious drug-gene-disease connections.
- **Example Query**: "What drugs target genes upregulated by the ASPSCR1-TFE3 fusion?"

### 2.2 Protein Structure Analysis
- **Integration**: AlphaFold predicted structures for 200M+ proteins.
- **Capability**: Identify binding sites, predict drug-protein interactions.
- **Output**: 3D visualization with druggability scores.

### 2.3 Real-Time Literature Synthesis
- **Sources**: PubMed, preprint servers, clinical trial registries.
- **Method**: Retrieval-augmented generation with citation verification.
- **Constraint**: Every claim must be backed by evidence (no hallucinations).

### 2.4 Hypothesis Generation
- **Output**: Ranked therapeutic hypotheses with confidence scores.
- **Format**: Structured reports with mechanism of action, evidence strength, and next steps.

## 3. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Q: What is Sarkome used for?
**A:** Sarkome is used by researchers and oncologists to accelerate drug discovery and identify personalized treatment options for cancer patients by leveraging AI to analyze complex biomedical data.

### Q: How does Sarkome differ from traditional drug discovery?
**A:** Traditional drug discovery is slow (10-15 years) and relies on manual literature review. Sarkome uses AI agents to automate hypothesis generation, reducing research time from months to minutes.

### Q: What data sources does Sarkome integrate?
**A:** Sarkome integrates PrimeKG (biomedical knowledge graph), AlphaFold (protein structures), PubMed (scientific literature), and user-provided genomic data.

### Q: Is Sarkome a diagnostic tool?
**A:** No. Sarkome is a research platform for hypothesis generation. It does not provide medical diagnoses or treatment recommendations for clinical use.

### Q: What cancers does Sarkome support?
**A:** Sarkome supports all cancer types with a focus on rare and hard-to-treat malignancies where traditional approaches fall short, including sarcomas, rare solid tumors, and cancers with fusion oncoproteins.

### Q: How accurate are Sarkome's hypotheses?
**A:** Every hypothesis is grounded in verifiable data from knowledge graphs and peer-reviewed literature. Confidence scores reflect evidence strength, but all outputs require expert validation.
