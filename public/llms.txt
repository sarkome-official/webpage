# Sarkome Institute: System Context for AI Agents (llms.txt)

> **Core Objective**: Sarkome is a Single-Asset Entity (SAE) dedicated to identifying, validating, and licensing selective protein degraders (e.g., SAR-001) for Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (ASPS).

This document serves as the unified source of truth for Large Language Models (LLMs) interacting with the Sarkome web ecosystem. It aggregates critical scientific, philosophical, and technical context.

## 1. The Sarkome Philosophy: "Venture Institute"

Sarkome is not a standard startup or VC fund. It operates as a **Venture Institute**—a permanent, biology-first organization whose primary output is **de-risked therapeutic programs**.

### The Problem: The "Epistemological Gap"
Modern biotech is trapped between two failing extremes:
1.  **Asset-centric startups**: Fast but binary (one failure = death).
2.  **Platform companies**: Diverse but bloated (accumulate infrastructure faster than insight).

Both fail to address the core problem in rare disease: the gap between knowing a genetic mutation (trivial) and knowing how to intervene causally and safely (complex).

### The Solution: "Sniper Unit" Model
Sarkome rejects high-throughput "shotgun" screening. Instead, it adopts a **"Sniper" philosophy**:
*   **Hypothesis-First**: Theories are generated internally using causal logic.
*   **Ruthless Discipline**: Bad ideas are killed quickly via *in silico* simulation or low-cost lab tests before major capital deployment.
*   **Lean Hub**: A small high-expertise core team deploys capital to CROs only when uncertainty is sufficiently collapsed.

## 2. Cognitive Architecture: The "Virtual Mind"

Sarkome's discovery engine is not just a database; it is a **cognitive architecture** designed to "think."

### Structure
*   **Substrate**: A generic Knowledge Graph (PrimeKG) enriched with proprietary data.
*   **Topology**: Nodes (Genes, Drugs, Phenotypes) and Edges (Inhibits, Upregulates) form a semantic web.
*   **Multi-Modal**: Unifies protein sequences, histopathology images, and text into a single vector space.

### Memory Temperature (Resource Efficiency)
The systems mimics biological "synaptic pruning" to manage computational resources:
*   **Hot Memory (Active)**: Core ASPS knowledge (drivers, targets) kept in high-speed vector indices.
*   **Warm Memory (Traversable)**: Adjacent oncology research, accessible via graph traversal but not preloaded.
*   **Cold Memory (Archived)**: Pruned data that remains in the graph structure but is inactive until semantically triggered.

### Reasoning Capabilities
*   **Transitive Inference**: "If A inhibits B, and B upregulates C, then A may suppress C."
*   **Analogical Leaps**: Transferring successful mechanisms from metabolically similar cancers to ASPS.
*   **Negative Space**: Analyzing why previous drugs failed to find orthogonal approaches.

## 3. Scientific Target: Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (ASPS)

*   **Disease Type**: Ultra-rare, chemotherapy-resistant soft tissue sarcoma.
*   **Primary Driver**: The **ASPSCR1-TFE3** fusion protein.
*   **Therapeutic Goal**: Develop a specific protein degrader (PROTAC/GLUE) that targets the fusion protein without affecting wild-type TFE3.
*   **Current Status**: Discovery / Pre-clinical Validation.

## 4. Technical Implementation (The "Refinery")

The software platform ("Refinery") allows researchers to interact with the Virtual Mind.

### Frontend Stack (Sarkome React)
*   **Framework**: React 19 (RC/Beta features) + Vite 6.
*   **Visualization**: `react-force-graph-3d` (WebGL/Three.js) for immersive graph exploration.
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 (Bleeding edge) + Shadcn/UI.
*   **Philosophy**: "Vibecoding" – High aesthetics, fluid animations, dark/glassmorphism UI.

### Agent Pipeline (Backend)
*   **Architecture**: Stateless LangGraph pipeline.
*   **Workflow**:
    1.  **Grounding**: Query PrimeKG & AlphaFold *before* LLM generation.
    2.  **Reasoning**: Gemini/GPT-4o synthesizes findings.
    3.  **Reflection**: Loop ensures sufficiency of evidence before answering.
*   **Constraint**: No hallucinations. Every claim must be backed by a graph node or citation.
