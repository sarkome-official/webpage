# Platform: The Virtual Engine

Executing drug discovery cheaply and quickly without owning a wet lab.

## The Virtual Engine

We replace the traditional, capital-intensive biotech model with a lean, agentic loop. Our AI agents design and filter compounds in silico, which are then synthesized and tested by top-tier CRO partners. Data flows back into the system to refine the next cycle.

### Agentic AI → Design & Filter
Computational design and virtual screening of compounds

### Cloud Lab → Synthesize & Test
Partner-based wet-lab validation and assays

## Technical Stack

### AlphaFold 3 (Structure)
Used to predict the precise 3D structure of the ASPSCR1-TFE3 fusion protein and its interactions with E3 ligases.

### DiffDock (Binding)
Performs molecular docking simulations to predict how small molecules bind to the target pocket with high accuracy.

### DeepTernary (PROTAC Modeling)
Specialized for PROTACs, modeling the ternary complex (Target + Linker + E3 Ligase) to ensure efficient degradation.

## Operational Readiness: Cloud Partners

We leverage partnerships with industry-leading CROs to execute our wet-lab validation:

- **WuXi AppTec**: Large-scale compound synthesis and screening
- **Charles River**: Preclinical ADME and safety testing
- **Emerald Cloud Lab**: Robotic cloud-based experimentation platform

These are potential and necessary partnerships to enable the execution of this project.

## Key Advantages

- **No fixed lab infrastructure**: Eliminates capital-intensive wet lab buildout
- **Flexible capacity scaling**: Partner throughput matches project phase needs
- **Speed to data**: Rapid compound evaluation cycles
- **Cost efficiency**: Pay-per-experiment model rather than fixed overhead
