## Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (ASPS)

### What is ASPS?

Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (ASPS) is an ultra-rare, malignant soft tissue sarcoma that primarily strikes adolescents and young adults. Unlike common cancers that arise from decades of cellular aging or environmental damage, ASPS is driven by a specific, catastrophic genetic accident.

It is a disease of contradictions: it grows slowly (indolent) but spreads aggressively (metastatic). It often arises deep within the muscles of the limbs in adults, or the head and neck in children, frequently going unnoticed until it has already traveled to the lungs or brain.

### The Biological Driver: The "Fusion"

While most cancers are chaotic, ASPS is deterministic. It is caused by a single chromosomal translocation, **t(X;17)(p11;q25)**, which fuses two genes that should never meet: **ASPSCR1** and **TFE3**.

This creates a chimeric oncoprotein, **ASPSCR1-TFE3**, which acts as a "molecular dictator":

* 
**Nuclear Hijacking:** The fusion protein enters the cell nucleus and stays there, overriding normal safety switches.


* 
**Epigenetic Rewiring:** It recruits massive cellular machinery, specifically **Super-Enhancers** and the **VCP/p97 complex**, to physically restructure the genome.


* 
**The Result:** It forces the cell to activate programs for unlimited growth and massive blood vessel creation (angiogenesis).



### Why is it so hard to treat?

ASPS presents a unique challenge to modern oncology:

1. 
**Chemotherapy Resistance:** Standard sarcoma chemotherapies (like Doxorubicin), which work by killing fast-dividing cells, are largely ineffective against ASPS.


2. 
**The "Orphan" Status:** Because it affects so few people (less than 1% of soft tissue sarcomas), it lacks the commercial incentive for large pharmaceutical companies to develop dedicated drugs.


3. 
**Vascular Shielding:** The tumor creates a dense network of blood vessels to feed itself, making it resilient and prone to early metastasis.



### The Sarkome Strategy

Current treatments, such as Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) and Immunotherapy (Atezolizumab), manage the disease but rarely cure it because they target the symptoms (blood vessels) rather than the root cause.

**Our mission is different.** We are using GenDiscovery to find molecules that target the **ASPSCR1-TFE3 fusion itself** and its structural dependencies, specifically the **VCP complex**. By breaking the machinery the fusion uses to survive, we aim to induce a "synthetic lethal" collapse of the tumor.
