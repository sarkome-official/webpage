# Building a Multi-Agent System for Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (ASPS)

This is not merely a development schedule; it is our strategic battle plan to bridge the gap between data and a cure. We are systematically building a multi-agent system capable of solving the logic of ASPS.

### Phase 1: Semantic Ingestion (In Progress)

**"Structuring the Chaos"**
We are currently transforming the fragmented landscape of scientific literature into a structured, navigable map. We cannot reason without a "Ground Truth."

* 
**Objective:** Construct the high-fidelity Biomedical Knowledge Graph (BKG) specific to Sarcoma biology.


* **Actions:**
* Deploying NLP agents to extract semantic "triplets" (Gene-Interaction-Drug) from PubMed and ChEMBL.


* Mapping unstructured text to strict ontologies to eliminate ambiguity.


* Implementing **GraphRAG** to enable the system to "traverse" connections between distant papers.





### Phase 2: The Neuro-Symbolic Logic Engine

**"From Search to Inference"**
In this phase, we activate the "intelligence" of the system. We move beyond retrieving what humans have already written and start inferring what has yet to be discovered.

* 
**Objective:** Enable the system to generate novel hypotheses using rigorous logic.


* **Actions:**
* Integration of **DeepProbLog** to fuse neural pattern matching with inviolable biological rules.


* Deployment of Autonomous Agents: The "Structural Biologist" (hunting for binding pockets) and the "Medicinal Chemist" (scanning for molecular fits).


* Quantifying "Epistemological Uncertainty", teaching the AI to know what it *doesn't* know.





### Phase 3: *In Silico* Simulation & "The Creator"

**"Validating the Probable"**
Before we spend a single dollar in a physical lab, we rigorously test our hypotheses in the digital world. We shift from "plausible" ideas to "probable" solutions.

* 
**Objective:** Filter candidates through virtual stress tests to identify the most potent therapeutic combinations.


* **Actions:**
* 
**Structural Validation:** Triggering **AlphaFold-Multimer** pipelines to verify if proposed drugs actually bind to the fusion protein interface.


* 
**Causal Inference:** Using "Digital Twin" simulations to ask counterfactual questions (e.g., "*If we block VCP, will the tumor develop resistance via CDK6?*").


* Activation of "The Creator" agent to propose novel drug repurposing strategies.





### Phase 4: The Wet-Lab Validation Loop

**"Closing the Circuit"**
The ultimate test. We connect our digital brain to the physical world to prove our predictions and refine our logic.

* 
**Objective:** Convert digital code into biological results.


* **Actions:**
* Generating **Executable Experimental Protocols** (precise instructions for cell lines and dosages) for partner labs.


* Establishing the Feedback Loop: Feeding success/failure data back into the Knowledge Graph to retrain the logic weights.


* Open-sourcing the ASPS Knowledge Graph to the global research community.
