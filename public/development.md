# Development: Roadmap to Clinic

A rigorous, milestone-driven path from discovery to clinical entry, structured in investable tranches (2026–2031).

## Current Phase

**Phase 1**: In Silico Validation & Hit Generation

## Phase 1: In Silico Validation & Hit Generation (Months 0–9)

**Objective**: Identify chemical matter (binders) for the ASPSCR1-TFE3 fusion using structural biology and computational design.

**Activities**:
- **1.1 Target Modeling**: Generate conformational ensembles of ASPSCR1-TFE3 using AlphaFold 3 + MD. Map interface hotspots.
- **1.2 Virtual Screening**: DiffDock campaigns against hotspots using fragment binders and E3 ligase ligands.
- **1.3 Ternary Design**: Design PROTACs linking hits to VHL/CRBN E3 ligases using DeepTernary.

**Deliverable**: Prioritized list of 50–100 PROTAC designs ready for synthesis.

**Milestone**: Computationally Validated Hit List

## Phase 2: Biological Proof of Concept (Months 10–18)

**Objective**: Demonstrate selective degradation of ASPSCR1-TFE3 in ASPS cells and validate cellular phenotype.

**Activities**:
- **2.1 Synthesis**: Contract synthesis of top 50 designs (~$3k–$5k per compound).
- **2.2 Cloud Lab Screening**: HiBiT degradation assays in ASPS-1 cells. Establish DC₅₀ and Dmax metrics.
- **2.3 Selectivity**: Counter-screen vs. wild-type TFE3 and VCP to ensure fusion-specific degradation.
- **2.4 Phenotypic Screen**: Confirm cell death (CellTiter-Glo) and target engagement via qPCR/Western Blot.

**Deliverable**: 1–2 Lead Series with DC₅₀ < 100 nM and >70% degradation depth.

**Milestone**: Lead Declaration (Series A Trigger)

## Phase 3: Lead Optimization & In Vivo Efficacy (Months 19–30)

**Objective**: Develop drug-like properties and validate efficacy in in vivo tumor models.

**Activities**:
- **3.1 MedChem**: Optimize linkers for solubility, permeability, and metabolic stability (ADME profiling).
- **3.2 PK/PD**: Pharmacokinetic studies in mice to determine half-life and systemic exposure.
- **3.3 In Vivo Efficacy**: Test in ASPS patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Demonstrate tumor regression.

**Deliverable**: Preclinical Candidate (PCC) with validated in vivo efficacy and acceptable safety profile.

**Milestone**: Preclinical Candidate Nomination

## Phase 4: IND-Enabling Studies (Months 31–42)

**Objective**: Regulatory clearance package for human trials.

**Activities**:
- **4.1 GLP Toxicology**: Pivotal toxicology studies in rodent + non-rodent species. Establish NOAEL (No Observed Adverse Effect Level).
- **4.2 CMC**: Process development for GMP manufacturing of drug substance and product.
- **4.3 Regulatory**: Pre-IND meeting with FDA. Submit Investigational New Drug (IND) application.

**Deliverable**: FDA "Safe to Proceed" letter; regulatory clearance for Phase 1 initiation.

**Milestone**: Clinical Entry

## Phase 5: Clinical Proof of Concept & Exit (Year 4+)

**Objective**: Initiate clinical trials and prepare for strategic exit.

**Activity**:
- **Phase 1/2 Basket Trial**: Enroll patients with TFE3-rearranged malignancies (ASPS + tRCC). Establish safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy signals in humans.

**Exit Strategy**: Phase 1 safety + efficacy data typically triggers interest from large pharma partners for acquisition or co-development, or positions company for IPO.

**Milestone**: Phase 1 Data Readout & M&A/IPO

## Regulatory & Competitive Strategy

### Orphan Drug Designation (ODD)
Early filing for ODD for Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma provides:
- 7 years of market exclusivity
- Tax credits
- FDA fee waivers
- Reduced commercial risk

### Basket Trial Design
Clinical trials targeting all TFE3-rearranged malignancies (ASPS + translocation-associated RCC):
- Expands addressable market
- Accelerates patient enrollment
- Demonstrates cross-indication efficacy

### IP Fortress
Parallel patent filings throughout development ensure:
- Composition of matter claims
- Methods of use claims
- Formulation claims
- Manufacturing process protection
