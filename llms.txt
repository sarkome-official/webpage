# Sarkome

> Sarkome is a single-asset entity (SAE) dedicated to identifying, validating, and licensing a selective protein degrader (SAR-001) for Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (ASPS). We replace traditional R&D infrastructure with agentic AI agents coupled to cloud-based CRO partners, executing drug discovery efficiently and at a fraction of traditional biotech costs.

## Company Overview

**Mission**: To develop SAR-001, a selective PROTAC degrader targeting the ASPSCR1-TFE3 fusion protein in Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma.

**Business Model**: Single Asset Entity (SAE) with virtual-first drug discovery platform.

**Execution**: Agentic AI core (AlphaFold 3, DiffDock, DeepTernary) + cloud-based CRO partners (WuXi AppTec, Charles River, Emerald Cloud Lab).

**Timeline**: 5-year roadmap (2026–2031) from in silico design through clinical proof of concept.

**Exit Strategy**: Phase 1 data readout triggers large pharma acquisition interest or IPO positioning.

## Key Scientific Facts

- **Target Disease**: Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (ASPS), a rare (~500–1,000 new cases/year) translocation-driven sarcoma
- **Genetic Driver**: ASPSCR1-TFE3 fusion protein (found in ~100% of ASPS cases) - a constitutively active transcription factor
- **Therapeutic Modality**: Targeted Protein Degradation (PROTACs) - recruits the ubiquitin-proteasome system to degrade the fusion protein
- **Regulatory Path**: Orphan Drug Designation (7-year exclusivity) + Basket Trial strategy (ASPS + tRCC)
- **Current Status**: Phase 1 In Silico Validation (9 months); lead compounds in optimization

## Investment Thesis (3 Pillars)

1. **Monogenic Driver**: Single fusion protein reduces biological complexity; ~100% disease association eliminates polygenicity risk
2. **Validated Modality**: Targeted Protein Degradation is a proven clinical platform (multiple clinical programs); unlocks "undruggable" transcription factors
3. **Capital Efficient**: Virtual model eliminates fixed lab costs; capital flows directly to asset generation via CRO partnerships; extended runway
